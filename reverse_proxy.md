## Why is Nginx called a “𝐫𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐞” proxy?

The diagram below shows the differences between a 𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐰𝐚𝐫𝐝 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐱𝐲 and a 𝐫𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐞 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐱𝐲.

🔹 A forward proxy is a server that sits between user devices and the internet.

A forward proxy is commonly used for: 
1. Protect clients

2. Avoid browsing restrictions
3. Block access to certain content

🔹 A reverse proxy is a server that accepts a request from the client, forwards the request to web servers, and returns the results to the client as if the proxy server had processed the request.

A reverse proxy is good for:
1. Protect servers
2. Load balancing
3. Cache static contents
4. Encrypt and decrypt SSL communications
