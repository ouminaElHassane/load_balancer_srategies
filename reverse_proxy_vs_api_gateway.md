Do you need a Reverse Proxy or an API Gateway? 
 
A reverse proxy acts as an intermediary between clients and servers. 
 
Clients can only call the backend servers through the reverse proxy, which forwards the request to the appropriate server. 
 
But what's the point? 
 
A reverse proxy hides the implementation details of individual servers inside the internal network. 
 
Reverse proxy use cases: 
 
- Load balancing 
- Caching 
- Security 
- SSL termination 
 
API gateways are a specific type of reverse proxy. 
 
- Designed for managing APIs 
- Single entry point for API consumers 
 
Here are a few API gateway use cases: 
 
- Request routing and composition 
- Request/response transformations 
- Authentication and authorization 
- Rate limiting 
- Monitoring 
 
The lines between the two are fuzzy.
