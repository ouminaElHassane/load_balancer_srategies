üöÄ Understanding OAuth 2.0 Authentication! üöÄ

üîê OAuth 2.0 is a powerful and flexible framework for securing API access and managing user authorization. OAuth 2.0 is an authorization protocol that allows websites and applications to access other web apps' resources on behalf of a user. It's widely used in many applications, including:
 1)Web applications
 2)Desktop applications
 3)Mobile phones
 4)Living room devices
 5)API-based services
 6)Google APIs

Here's a quick breakdown of how it works, accompanied by a detailed architecture diagram:

1) Authorization Request:
The user initiates the process by requesting authorization.

2) Verify User Credentials:
The authorization server verifies the user's credentials by checking the credentials against a secure database.

3) Grant Authorization Token:
Once verified, the authorization server grants an authorization token to the user.

4) Hit API with Token:
The user sends a request to the API endpoint, including the authorization token.

5) Verify Token:
The API verifies the token with the authorization server to ensure it's valid.

6) Process Required Request:
Upon successful verification, the API processes the request and interacts with the necessary data source.

7) Return Responses:
The API returns the required response to the user in JSON or XML format.
