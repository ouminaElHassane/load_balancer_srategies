# Key Features in the Last 4 LTS Releases ðŸš€


## The Long-Term Support (LTS) versions of Java are released every three years, and as of 2024, the four most recent LTS versions are Java 21 (2023), Java 17 (2021), Java 11 (2018), and Java 8 (2014).

LTS refers to a version of the software that is supported for an extended period, usually several years. During this time, the software receives regular updates, including security patches and bug fixes, ensuring stability and reliability for users who rely on it for critical systems and applications.
Java's LTS releases are designed to offer a stable and robust platform for developers, allowing them to use these versions for a longer time without needing to upgrade frequently. LTS versions are ideal for enterprises and projects that prioritize long-term stability over adopting the latest features immediately. Typically, Java releases an LTS version every three years.
